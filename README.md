# Advent of Typescript 2023

Advent of Typescript in Local setup. All challenges can be found at Typescript Advent of Code 2020 [here](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023). Why tho you ask? Cause ain't nothing more comfy than your own ide and setup.

This also serves as a playgound for bun and biome.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Run checks:

```bash
bun check
```

Run Biome:

```bash
bun run lint
```

Nothing to run since we are only observing types here.
